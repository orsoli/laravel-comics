### Description:
**Create a new Laravel project.** 
- Focus on the layout: create a layout file where you insert the common structure of all the web pages (head tags, body tags, ...) potentially including header and footer through two partials. Then create a route to display the list of all comics retrieved from a file placed in the config folder, and enhance everything using Sass. 
### Bonus: 
- Create more institutional pages that share the same layout
